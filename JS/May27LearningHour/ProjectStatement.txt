Apollo client helps in state management. It's a bridge between UI and backend. It has a cache at UI level. It stores data in most optimal way. 
Apollo client doesnt allow us to trace changes in the cache. 

Make a watcher for this cache which tracks changes and makes snapshots for this. Check which operation is applied when cache changes from one state to another. 
Change the in built code of Apollo client. 
Phase 1 - check differences in both states
Phase 2 - Check the trigger - why it happened?

Apollo allows us to do calls using GraphQL

In redux, we were able to detect which functions changed the state.
