<!-- Doesn't work properly without semicolon-->

<script>
alert('Hello World!');
[1, 2].forEach(alert);

alert(3+
    2+
    1
); // Works properly without semicolon because the code doesn't assume a semicolon after incomplete expression

alert('Hello World!') 
[1, 2].forEach(alert); // Doesn't work properly without semicolon because the code doesn't assume a semicolon before square brackets

</script>
